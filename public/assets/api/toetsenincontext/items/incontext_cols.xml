                            identifier="id-1-p1">Ask an economist or a technology expert and they
            will happily tell you that decades of data reliably show automation has created more
            jobs than it has destroyed.</qti-hottext>
                        <qti-hottext class="type:lite"
                            identifier="id-2-p1">Far fewer of us now work on farms, for example,
            thanks to super-efficient machines that do the bulk of the work.</qti-hottext>
                        <qti-hottext
                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-3-p1">Such technology has boosted
            productivity and, with it, living standards.</qti-hottext>

                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-4-p1">As a result, more people work in
            leisure industries such as hospitality or hairdressing, serving all those people with
            higher disposable incomes and more free time.</qti-hottext>

                            identifier="id-1-p2">So far so good. And were the pattern to continue,
            one could envisage the realisation of the prediction made by John Maynard Keynes in 1930
            that the working week would eventually be cut, perhaps to just 15 hours.</qti-hottext>

                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-2-p2">The problem with this rose-tinted
            view of automation, however, is its focus on big averages that take little account of
            individuals' experiences.</qti-hottext>
                        <qti-hottext class="type:lite"
                            identifier="id-3-p2">Sure, the number of job gains for the whole of the
            UK is higher than the number lost to technology.</qti-hottext>

                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-4-p2"> But that is little consolation
            to someone who loses his job in a Midlands car plant to a robot and discovers most of
            the new openings are far afield in the coffee bars and hotels of London. </qti-hottext>

                            identifier="id-1-p3"> Nor do studies of what has gone before allow for
            the fact that the pace of technological change will probably be quicker in the future.</qti-hottext>

                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-2-p3"> In other words, evolutions that
            took place over previous decades may well have been <span id="p3gap1"
                                class="inlinechoicetext"></span> enough for most people to find new
            ways of making a living, with varying degrees of difficulty. </qti-hottext>

                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-3-p3">But faster and more widespread
            technological changes in the future are unlikely to be so easy to adapt to. </qti-hottext>

                            identifier="id-1-p4"> For governments, this imposes a pressing need to
            step in and ensure the rise of the robots is not accompanied by a further rise in <span

                        <qti-hottext class="type:lite" identifier="id-2-p4">As tempting as it
            may be to pour money into boosting automation in return for the long-awaited boost to
            productivity and headline economic growth, doing so without having a clear plan for
            retraining displaced workers would cause untold harm to millions of individuals.</qti-hottext>

                            class="type:lite" identifier="id-3-p4">As the Institute for Public
            Policy Research (IPPR) points out, some workers are far more vulnerable than others to
            automation. </qti-hottext>
                        <qti-hottext class="type:lite" identifier="id-4-p4">It
            highlights particular risks for low-skill sectors and warns that the robot revolution
            could widen Britain's already entrenched north-south divide. </qti-hottext>

                            identifier="id-1-p5"> The IPPR rightly calls for an urgent increase in
            investment in education and retraining. </qti-hottext>
