## assessment response

Responses from interaction in items are 'catched' by listening to events.
The `qti-interaction-changed` event has a payload of the item which dispatched event,
the interaction, the responseidentifier of the item and the responses in QTI3 JSON format

event details dispatched by an interaction when listening to `qti-interaction-changed` on the `qti-assessment-item`

```json
{ "item": "story_choice", "interaction": { "responseIdentifier": "RESPONSE_D3", "responses": "Choice2" } }
```

If you want the item to return to the stored state, just make a JSON object with the item as property
and the interactions as an array of interaction responses

response to be set on the `qti-assessment-item` with identifier `story_choice`

```json
[{ "responseIdentifier": "RESPONSE_D3", "response": "Choice2" }]
```
